## Hello World! I am Rongwu Xu (许融武) 👋

I am currently a PhD student focus on various topics regarding **NLP and AI**. I research how ML model’s design and human interactions shape its capability, behavior and alignment. Besides, I work on post-training, evaluation and application of NLP technologies.
