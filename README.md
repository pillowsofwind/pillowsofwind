## Hello World! I am Rongwu Xu (许融武) 👋

🤖 I am currently a Master's student focus on various topics regarding **NLP and AI**. I am particularly interested in **Human+NLP**, including understanding human aspects in LLMs and using LLMs to understand humans. I care about building language intelligence that thinks, acts like us and thus can be leveraged to augments human capabilities.

I often employ the following techniques:

- Data-Engineering: data curation, data-driven learning, synthetic data generation and data assessment
- Evaluation: benchmarks, metrics, protocols, simulation, analysis and philosophy of evaluation

🤗 **Always Seeking Collaborators:** If you are interested in my work (refer to [rongwuxu.com](https://rongwuxu.com)) or see potential for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me via [this Email](mailto:0xrwxu@gmail.com)!
